# 3D-Scanner
This project introduces an affordable 3D scanner utilizing distance sensor technology for scanning small objects and creating accurate digital models. The device consists of a rotating platform and an arc-shaped structure with two stepper motors. Despite a time-consuming process, the scanner effectively measures distances using IR sensors, enabling the creation of high-quality 3D images. Notably, the scanner can scan hollow objects and holds potential for future improvements, making it versatile for applications ranging from small object scanning to integration with augmented reality. This development highlights the progress in sensor technology and the growing significance of augmented reality in our daily lives.
